# Install and launch

I. The most straightforward way to run the app is follow the next steps:

1). ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (for Linux: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```)

2). In the main project folder execute: ```python main.py``` (for Linux: ```./main.py```)

II. **For Windows users** 

0). Download ```installer.exe```  and ```Pythonic Doom.exe``` from https://cloud.mail.ru/public/iqCS/2zsX6Z1ZR,
put them in the root of the project.

1). Execute ```installer.exe``` and follow the installation process.

2). After installation process finished, execute ```Pythonic Doom.exe```.

**Troubleshoting**

2.1. If script fails to run, try to paste the following DLLs next to main
(however, there is already ```libmpg123-0.dll``` in the project, adding this DLL fixed the issue on my PC):
```
libogg-0.dll
libmpg123-0.dll
libvorbis-0.dll
libvorbisfile-3.dll
libtiff-5.dll
libwebp-5.dill
libgcc-5-5jlj1.dll
```

It's about the issue https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/1514

"Pyinstaller has a problem with packaging up the pygame project.
You have to copy all the libxxxx.dll (especially "libogg-0.dll") from pygame files and paste them into your "main" file.
This will solve the problem."

2.2. If error "MSVCP140.dll is missing" pops out, please install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable.

3). If you could overcome the issues, ENJOY the game :)
